I made the snake and flappy bird terminal games a long time ago so the sorce code has been lost to time. I only have the exe's.
Be carefull to not look at the games to much they do hurt your eyes with all its blinking after a while.
I have had problems while sharing the flappy bird game with friends that it gets an error and won't boot so if you have that error idk how to fix it
