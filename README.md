# many-small-games
A place for me to store and share all my small games

- I like to make small games on my freetime but I don't want to make a seperate repository for every small game so I desided to make one big one for all the small games.
- I am not the most productive person in the world so I will make a little whenever I feel like it.
- I like to develop my games on linux so the games will work the best there. Most games should also work on windows.

## How to play
- ### Python
To play python games you need to open a terminal and cd to the directory where the game is. Then run `python nameOfGame.py`. You will of course have to have python installed on your machine for this to work. If the game is using pygame you need to have that installed as well, you install pygame by typing `pip install pygame` into the terminal.
