# many-small-games
A place for me to store and share all my small games

- I like to make small games on my freetime but I don't want to make a seperate repository for every small game so I desided to make one big one for all the small games.
- I am not the most productive person in the world so I will make a little whenever I feel like it.
- I like to develop my games on linux so the games will work the best there. Most games should also work on windows. 
- Tho older games where created on windows and therefor work better on exclusivly on windows unless you compile the code yourself.
- Some sorce codes may have been lost to time but I still put theme here so people can play/try out my work and as a place to save games with big memories to me.

## How to play
- ### Python
To play the python games you need to open a terminal and cd to the directory where the game is. Then run `python nameOfGame.py`. You will of course have to have python installed on your machine for this to work. If the game is using pygame you need to have that installed as well, you install pygame by typing `pip install pygame` into the terminal.

- ### C/C++
To play the C/C++ games made with raylib you just need to open the exe file. The games was made on and for windows so if you have any other operative systems need will have to compile the sorce code yourself (the comiler settings I used are in the run.ps1 file). I used [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) to make the games so if you are having troubles with that you'll need to visit ther site for a never update.

To play the C/C++ games for the terminal everything about the raylib still applies, without the having to update libraries part
